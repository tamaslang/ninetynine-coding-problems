/**
 **[P26](p26.scala) (**) Generate the combinations of _K_ distinct objects chosen from the _N_ elements of a list.**
In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12 people? We all know that there are `C(12,3) = 220` possibilities (`C(N,K)` denotes the well-known binomial coefficient). For pure mathematicians, this result may be great. But we want to really generate all the possibilities. Example:
scala> combinations(3, List('a, 'b, 'c, 'd, 'e, 'f))
res0: List[List[Symbol]] = List(List('a, 'b, 'c), List('a, 'b, 'd), List('a, 'b, 'e), ...
